    \section{Introduction}

    Modern Internet services are often implemented as complex, large-scale distributed systems. 
    These applications are constructed from collections of software modules that could span many
    thousands of machines across multiple physical facilities. With the rise of modern 
    Micro-service and Service-Oriented designs, traditional tooling used to monitor application 
    behaviour is no longer viable, especially at scale. To understanding the flow and lifecycle 
    of a unit of work performed in multiple pieces across various components in a distributed system, 
    the concept of Distributed Tracing was born. 
    Distributed Tracing was first introduced to the mainstream world in 2010 after the publication
    of Googleâ€™s Dapper paper. Since then, various vendors have come out with their own Dapper-inspired
    services, most of them based off flame or timeline graphs.

    \section{Distributed Tracing}
    The concept of Distributed Tracing has existed for over a decade at the time of writing. 
    This section will provide a brief history and overview of the concept and implementations of Distributed Tracing,
    from the first published paper of the implementation at Google to modern day standards.

        \subsection{Dapper}
        Released in April 2010,
        Google published a paper describing the design decisions behind an in-house implementation of distributed tracing,
        named Dapper. It is commonly believed that this paper describes the common ancestor to many tools that implement
        a form of distributed tracing.

        \paragraph{}
        The Dapper paper introduces some of the core primitives that underpin modern day standards. Most notable are the concepts
        of a \textit{trace tree} and its nodes, which are referred to as \textit{spans}. The trace tree forms a relationship between
        spans, not unakin to a stack trace, including however, continuing the analogy, stack frames over time, rather than just the 
        active stack frames at a certain point in time.
