# Alternative Visualisation of Distributed Tracing data in a complex, large-scale distributed system

Final year project for University College Cork BSc in Computer Science. Exploring visualisations of distributed tracing data
and implementing OpenTracing tracer shims to collect runtime and compile time information with which to enrich spans to ultimately
be consumed by a debug adapter and debug extension for Visual Studio Code to step through code in a multi-repo polyglot distributed 
system, powered by a GraphQL API server.
